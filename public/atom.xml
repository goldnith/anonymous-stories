        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Caution this story involves 18+ wordings , ok let's get into the story

On a rainy day, A man was walking on the street , the man was wet all over because of the rain and he rushes towards a nearby store to not get in the rain . while he goes there the rain starts to pick up and there was this girl also coming at the same store to not get in the rain . The man sees the girl's face and he felt "Love at first sight" . she also had slight interest in him after meeting each other at this spot . They greeted each after both were gazing for sometime to stop the awkwardness between them . They talked a lot even the rain slows down , they didn't noticed the rain is stopped but they found attractive and interested to talk to each other . Now they fallen in love to each other . They planned for a date for the next day and they were getting ready for the upcoming date they were expecting.

The next day : The girl was getting ready for the date and she was excited because they didn't planned for where they have to go to the date . She locked her home and going to the bus stop for the bus to get to the spot they were to meet . She was walking alone in her street , it was unusually silent in that day and she felt a little odd for the place to be this silent . She also had this uneasy feeling that someone might have been following her from her home, But she was happy because of the date . A group of men confronting her about locations and a van suddenly stopped nearby them . suddenly a man closed her mouth and grabbed her and thrown her in the van . Then she realized she was been plotted to get kidnapped from the beginning , she tried all her force to get away from the situation but she cant move a finger from her situation.

At the same time the man who had his date on this fine day is waiting for her in the spot they were supposed to meet which is the same store they were used to not get wet from the rain the other day.
He waited and waited and waited also waited for hours but she didn't came . So he knows her home by the other day they talked about where they live , he went there by using transports and found that her home by asking the neighborhood of her , and he found the house of her and it was locked and he had a bad feeling about this because she promised to come and she isn't home . He also tried shouting in front of her home by her name , but no reply . His instincts are going insane and having a hunch that there might be something wrong happened to her . So he went to the the nearby bus stop and found her handbag and he sees it that it was his date's . He rushed to the nearby police department and filed a case but they refused to take it because he is not related to her in anyways , he also tried by saying that he is her husband but they didn't . He lost hope of them and he started searching nearby through the bus stops . And he there was a nearby hill side and tried searching there

few hours ago  : The van went to the nearby hillside of the bus stop and there were a total of 5 men in the van . They stopped there and thrown her and away started her stripping her using a knife and the men were also stripping , she couldn't scream because her mouth was tied up and they tied her in a bed by stretching her arms and legs to the four corners of the bed . They r*ped her for hours and they dressed her up in the torn way and hanged her in a tree by making it up as suicide.

To the present time : The man went deep in to the hills so he might some clues , due to the rain on the other day the trails of the van was imprinted on the hill and he seen it strange because the hill was a non populated area and there was no roads why would a vehicle should come over here and followed the trail of the tires and he seen it stopped nearby a cluster of trees and he something is hanging and that his girlfriend is hanging with no life , he screamed and untied her and shouted that " I swore i would avenge your death " .

He made a proper burial for her and prayed for her and he didn't wanted to know anyone about her death because the world doesn't give a sh!t about a missing girl so he started by the trail of the vehicle tires but unfortunately the road doesn't imprints any trail. So he waited for several days that his instincts were believed that the men who violated his girlfriend might come one day with another victim or they might come to check up the mess they did . He waited and after a week passed he was waiting up in the tree his girlfriend hanged and he heard a vehicle coming to his way and he seen there was a van coming to the same spot and they were setting up a bed and several ropes , he sees a girl who is tied and unconscious in the van . There were 5 men , 3 were setting up and 2 were in the van , he also noticed that one of the man was a police he confronted that time . So he had doubts and all missing pieces were connected why they didn't gave a f*ck about a missing girl . So with pure rage and all his brute might peaked an he let his inner rage do whatever it wants he murdered every one of them without ay hesitation but full of wrath he unleashed . He didn't get satisfied so he wrote a letter to the world about what happened to his girlfriend and what are the things happened in this unpopulated area and given to the girl ( 2nd victim he witnessed ) and said hand it over to a trusted higher ups. 

The letter was sent to a Court and they took action on the police department and they arrested our because he also committed crime ( murdering the 5 men ) , also he accepted and he happily went to prison and had smile on his face and he said facing up the sky " I'd let the world burn for you "

Message from author : hey guys , I know there should have more elements added to the love story to make it look like their love was strong bonding for the plot , don't hate me just imagine there was a strong bonding after their first meeting. Thank you for reading

Inspiration from a song called I'd let the world burn and bit of elements from some games i played and some elements from movies.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[On a fine evening at 19:00 , a boy doing his home works in his room suddenly a dimensional warp has been opened in front of his eyes , The boy was surprised to see this because he always thought of something unnatural would happen in his life and it became true in front of his eyes . From the dimensional warp a man appeared he looks like he is in his late 40s , the boy realized its should be some kind of portal or any time travelling thing , then the boy seen his face felt some familiar feeling.

Time 19:30 , The boy realized that the man kind of looks like him but older , so he surprised and interrogated with questions like "who are you? , where do you come from? and how did you come here?" But the man unfazed and said that , its been so long since i seen the place like this and looks straight into the boy's eyes directly. The boy thought is he an idiot or something because of the man didn't even answered his questions yet and staring at him .

Time 19:40 , The man suddenly rushed to search something in the boy's room and found a old book which has an formulae for the dimensional warp that the boy wrote something for fun in his yearly teenage years , The man's felt happy and said ,finally the formulae to reconstruct the work of warm hole travelling between past to future is found . The boy seen everything this and thought of himself that he might be an idiot and asked the why are you happy seeing about a stupid thing i wrote years ago , The man fiercely seen the boy asked  You still not recognize me boy , I am the future self of you , I persuaded the time theory and succeeded in working on that because of your ambition of being a physicist and found way to travel back in time and didn't found a way to the future travelling so did i thought of the formulae we discovered back when we were in our teenage , and i searched for the notebook all week in my timeline but i couldn't find it so then i realized that i could travel back in time here to find the book .

Time 20:00 Then the man said that he should get to future as soon as possible before they find me out . The boy asked who is coming after you and why , you are doing a good thing he said . The man said that there was a law in the future without any official reasons time lines should not be changed as i interacted with you that you know that your future is known and it will become a different time line and the possibility of time travel to past might change several times .

Time 20:05 The man used a remote like thing to summon a warp and went inside , the boy was confused and thought that , how he would return to his present day if there wasn't a thing to return to future if only going to past is a thing and going to future not a thing is developed .

Time 20:15 The boy was even more confused and made an assumption , that the man should have told him a lie that going to future isn't a thing and the formulae he took from him isn't used for going to future with warm holes but for something else.

Present time ( for the future self ) : The man thought of himself , oh Sh!t thats why i can't find the note in my present because i took in the past . so there isn't a different timeline happened but time paradox happened ( basically no matter what it always ends the same which meant the timeline goes in a circle again and again ) . And because there is no change in the past or in future the time patrol didn't come after him.

At last the boy remained silent after the incident and after 2 decades , he became an astrophysics scientist and invented time machine using warm hole theory but he missing something for another invention for something else on his mind which left him uneasy because that was in a formulae that he wrote back when he was in his mid teenage years and he searched for the note he wrote in a note in his parents old home but he couldn't find it anywhere so he had no choice but to go to the past and retrieve it .

And he did ( guess what to continue the story read from first line )

Thank you for reading guys , I know it has too much flaws on science but its a fictional story so in fiction science could be anything.
Note : The paragraphs with time indicates the point of view for the boy's and the after the present time the same boy's point view in his present self.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[          Once there was a plant that tryna survive in this world and it believed that it can bloom even without any support of water . so it started its journey as growing , One day it thought other plants are seeking for water to grow and it realized that maybe it also needed some water to grow . Then it seeks for water and found water nearby in its area . But the water was never meant for this plant but for other plants . 
 
          After finding that it was never meant for it , it went into a deep depression and plant started to fade aa bit , then after some while it got humidity air breeze . By that it started to grow a bit , but it wasn't enough for it to grow . Then after a few months , it started again as it was never dependent on water to grow but to stay with humidity air that was coming once in a while. Soon it seen that other plants getting water and they all grew many times faster than it is . 

          Soon after a while , there was this person seen pity on this plant and poured a little bit of water she had and the plant was in joy of getting water from this lady , day by day it gets the water it needed and the plant lived a healthy life . After a year passed , One day the lady didn't watered the plant , day after day she didn't even came to see it . The plant went into despair of that it going to die because she is the last hope it had and the plant believed that one day she will come back .

          After several months passed and one day the plant seen the lady , but the lady seems to forgotten about the plant , she didn't seem to care about the plant . After witnessing the moment the plant felt heart broken and still living with the same thoughts of being watered by her and nurtured by her. The plant is living in no need of water to live and , didn't wanted any hope for it .But in the deepest of its heart it needed someone to take care of it.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In everyone's life there should be a person, who gives you smile, pleasure, strength, knowledge, comfort zone, good feelings......

And another person, who gives you hurt, bad feelings, sadness, broken heart......

For most of us, the person who gives both feelings must be the same person.

It's not their fault, it's all our fault to expect more, gives unconditional love and becomes favourite person to the annoying person....

So whoever you likes.... Give them space. Don't make them feel like to leave you....

If we didn't give space... The space will extend untill it breakpoint.... Then there should be no way to stick it again.....]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Iâll tell you what kind of man I really am. I have no strength, but I want it all. I have no knowledge but all I do is dream. Thereâs nothing I can do, but I struggle in vain like an idiot.

Iâ¦ I hateâ¦ I hate myself!

All I do is talk a big game and make myself sound like a big shot when I canât do anything. I never do anything, yet I complain with the best of them like itâs my job or something. Who the hell do I think I am? Iâm a fraud, itâs amazing I can live like this and not feel ashamed. You know Iâm right! Iâm an empty shell. Thereâs nothing inside me at all. I know there isnât. Guess thatâs obvious. Anybody could see that. Before I came to this place, before I got into the situation that led me to all of you. Do you have any idea what I did with my life? I did nothing, thatâs what. Iâve never done a single thing worth mentioning. I had all that time and freedom and squandered it away on nothing. I couldâve done anything with my life, but I never did a damn thing and what youâre looking at now is the result. This cowardly weak worthless crybaby. All of my powerlessness, all of my incompetence, is the product of my rotten empathetic character. Wanting to accomplish something important when Iâve never done anything it earn it, goes way beyond the limitations of arrogance. The cost of my lifetime of laziness and all the wasteful habits I forged along the way, just ends up killing me.

Thatâs right, I have no character. Even when I thought I could go on living here, nothing changed about who I really am.

I wasnât trying to get stronger, or trying to make things better. That was a lie. I was just striking an obvious pose to justify myself. To say that I was trying my best. That it wasnât like I wasnât doing anything. To be able to appear to be doing everything I could. I wanted to say I couldnât help it. To be told that it couldnât be helped. I was only pretending to push my body to the limit so that all those excuses would be possible. Even when I had you help me study, I was just posing to cover up how embarrassed I felt to be such an incompetent idiot. Deep down inside, at the core of my heart Iâm just a small cowardly filthy piece of trash whoâs always worried about how theyâll see me, about how theyâll accept or judge me and nothingâ¦ nothing about me has changed!

Iâve known it since the very beginning, everything that was happening was my fault. Iâm the lowest of the low.

I absolutely hate myself.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[In a small town, there was a zoo that was famous for its mischievous monkey named Max. Max was no ordinary monkeyâhe was a mastermind. He had figured out how to pick locks, distract zookeepers, and even trade snacks with other animals. But Max had one obsession: bananas. He loved them more than anything in the world.

One day, the zookeepers decided to host a "Banana Festival" to raise money for the zoo. They imported thousands of bananas from all over the worldâyellow ones, red ones, even blue ones from some exotic island. Max watched from his enclosure as trucks full of bananas rolled in. His eyes widened, and his brain started plotting.

The night before the festival, Max executed his plan. He picked the lock on his enclosure (using a paperclip heâd stolen from a zookeeperâs pocket), sneaked into the storage room, and started loading bananas into a stolen wheelbarrow. But Max wasnât just stealing bananas for himselfâhe had a grander plan.

He wheeled the bananas to the lionâs enclosure. The lion, who was usually grumpy, perked up when he saw Max. âWhatâs this?â the lion growled.

âA deal,â Max said, handing over a bunch of bananas. âI need your roar. Distract the zookeepers while I move the bananas.â

The lion, who had never tasted a banana before, took a bite. His eyes lit up. âDeal!â he roared.

Next, Max went to the elephant. âHey, big guy,â Max said, offering a mountain of bananas. âI need your trunk to help me carry these.â

The elephant, who was always up for a snack, agreed immediately. âBut where are we taking them?â he asked.

âTo the giraffe,â Max said with a sly grin. âHeâs the lookout.â

The giraffe, who had the best view of the zoo from his tall neck, was already in on the plan. Max had promised him a lifetime supply of bananas in exchange for his silence and cooperation.

As the lion let out a deafening roar, the zookeepers rushed to his enclosure, thinking he was in distress. Meanwhile, Max, the elephant, and the giraffe worked together to move all the bananas to the zooâs fountain, where Max had built a secret banana stash.

The next morning, the zookeepers arrived to find the storage room empty. Panic set in. âWhere are all the bananas?!â they cried.

Just then, Max appeared, sitting on top of the fountain, surrounded by bananas. He held up a sign that read: âBanana Tax: Pay 1 peanut per banana to access.â

The zookeepers were stunned. The visitors, however, found it hilarious. They started tossing peanuts to Max, who happily handed out bananas in return. The festival turned into a huge success, with Max as the star.

From that day on, Max was no longer just a monkeyâhe was the Banana King of the zoo. And every year, the zoo hosted the âBanana Festival,â with Max in charge of the banana distribution (for a small peanut fee, of course).

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[
Leo had spent his entire life chasing legends. As an archaeologist, he had uncovered ancient ruins, deciphered forgotten languages, and even dodged a few death traps along the way. But nothing excited him more than the myth of Zorathâa hidden city said to be filled with gold, secrets, and something far more dangerous.

For years, scholars dismissed Zorath as a fairy tale. But when Leo found an old map hidden inside a Mayan temple, he knew he was onto something. The markings pointed to the Amazon rainforest, deep in uncharted territory.

With his guide, Isabella, and a small team, Leo set off on the journey of a lifetime.

The Journey Begins
The rainforest was unforgivingâdense vines, venomous creatures, and the constant hum of unseen predators. Days turned into weeks as they hacked through the thick jungle, following the mapâs cryptic symbols.

Then, one evening, Isabella shouted, âLeo! Look at this!â

They had stumbled upon a massive stone archway, covered in vines and ancient carvings. This was it. The entrance to Zorath.

As they stepped through, the ground trembled. A deep rumbling sound echoed through the air. Suddenly, the stone floor beneath them gave way!

The City Below
Leo woke up in darkness. The fall had landed them in a vast underground chamber, illuminated by strange glowing crystals embedded in the walls. But what caught his breath was what lay aheadâ

A golden city, untouched by time.

Zorath was real. Towers of shimmering gold, statues of forgotten gods, and streets lined with intricate carvings. But something feltâ¦ wrong.

"Leo," Isabella whispered. "We're not alone."

The Guardians Awaken
From the shadows, stone figures began to move. Their eyes glowed blue as they stepped forwardâguardians of the lost city.

Leo grabbed Isabellaâs hand. "Run!"

The team sprinted through the golden streets as the statues came to life, their heavy footsteps shaking the ground. Dodging collapsing pillars and ancient traps, they reached the temple at the city's center.

Inside, they found an enormous golden sphere, pulsing with energy. The source of the cityâs power.

Leo made a choice. If they took the gold, the city would crumble. But if they left it untouched, Zorath would remain hidden for eternity.

With a heavy heart, he whispered, "Some things are meant to stay lost."

They fled just as the entrance sealed shut, trapping the golden city once more.

As they emerged into daylight, Leo looked back at the ruins. He had found Zorath, but the world would never know.

And maybe, just maybe, that was for the best.]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Jake had always dreamed of getting a pet, but he never expected to find this ad in the newspaper:

"Talking dog for sale. $10."

Curious (and skeptical), he drove to the address listed. An old man greeted him at the door.

"You really have a talking dog?" Jake asked.

The old man nodded and pointed to the backyard.

Jake walked outside and saw a scruffy golden retriever lounging under a tree. Feeling ridiculous, he cleared his throat and muttered, "Uhâ¦ can you talk?"

The dog looked up, sighed, and said, "Yeah, of course I can talk. But I donât do tricks."

Jakeâs jaw dropped. "WHAT?! You can actually speak?"

"Yeah, yeah," the dog yawned. "I used to work for the CIA. Spent years eavesdropping on criminals. I know five languages, but honestly, retirement suits me better. I just want to chill now."

Jake was stunned. He ran back inside. "Why are you selling this incredible dog for just $10?!"

The old man shrugged. "Because heâs a liar. He never worked for the CIA."

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[Lena had just moved into a small apartment in an old building downtown. The landlord was kind but odd. As he handed her the keys, he hesitated and said, âThereâs just one thingâ¦ never look through the keyhole of the door at the end of the hallway.â

Lena laughed. âWhy?â

His face turned serious. âJust donât.â

That night, curiosity gnawed at her. The hallway was silent, dimly lit by a single flickering bulb. She walked toward the mysterious door, her footsteps barely making a sound on the creaky wooden floor.

Heart pounding, she leaned down and peeked through the keyhole.

She saw a room bathed in deep red light. In the center stood a tall figure, its back turned to her. It didnât move, didnât breatheâjust stood there, eerily still.

Uneasy, Lena pulled back and hurried to her apartment, convincing herself it was just some weird art installation.

The next night, she couldnât resist looking again. This time, the figure was closer to the door. Still motionless. Still facing away.

Her stomach twisted in fear. She ran back to her room, locked her door, and forced herself to sleep.

By the third night, she could no longer fight her curiosity. One final look. Just one.

As she peered through the keyhole, her blood turned to ice.

The figure was right on the other side, staring back at her.

But the eye she saw was pure red.

She stumbled back, heart hammering. The landlordâs words echoed in her head. She needed answers.

The next morning, she found him and demanded an explanation. His face paled.

âMany years ago, a couple lived in that room. The wife was a kind woman, but the husbandâ¦ he went mad. One night, he painted her entire body red. Then he took her eyes.â

Lenaâs breath caught.

The landlordâs voice dropped to a whisper.

âAnd now, her spirit still lingers there, waiting for someone to lookâ¦ so she can see again.â]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[James loved his morning coffee routine. Every day, he visited the same cafÃ© on his way to work. The place had a cozy vibe, and the barista, a tall guy with a quirky sense of humor, always had something weird to say.

One morning, as James stepped up to order, the barista leaned in and whispered, "Your usual, Earthling?"

James laughed. "Yeah, sure. Waitâ¦ Earthling?"

The barista gave him a knowing smile. "Ah, my bad. I'm still adjusting to your customs."

James chuckled. "You're funny, man. I'll have my usual cappuccino."

But instead of making the drink, the barista pulled out a strange-looking device and scanned James from head to toe. BEEP.

"Huh," the barista muttered. "Still no tentacles. Weird."

James frowned. "What?"

"Nothing, nothing. One cappuccino coming right up," the barista said quickly, pushing some buttons on the coffee machine. But instead of steaming milk, the machine hummed, glowed green, and made a strange buzzing noise.

A second later, a cup of coffee appearedâfloating in midair.

James stared. "How did youâ"

The barista grabbed the cup nonchalantly and placed it in front of him. "Enjoy! That'll be $4.50. Or 12 Glipnarks if you prefer intergalactic currency."

James blinked. "Uh... right. Here's five dollars."

As he walked away, sipping his coffee, he heard the barista mumble, "Humans are so oblivious."

James wasn't sure if he should be amused or terrified. But one thing was certainâthis was the best coffee he'd ever had.]]></content>
